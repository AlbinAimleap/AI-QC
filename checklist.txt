Checklists for Code Review and Error Prevention:

Code Style and Structure:
- Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines (proper indentation, line length, naming conventions)
- Functions are single-purpose and follow SOLID principles
- Variables and functions have clear, descriptive names
- Code is properly modularized with clear separation of concerns
- Comments explain complex logic and business rules
- Type hints and docstrings are properly implemented

Error Handling and Runtime Protection:
- Try-except blocks catch specific exceptions rather than bare except
- Custom exception classes for business logic errors
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Resource management using context managers (with statements)
- Timeout handling for external operations
- Memory leak prevention in loops and data processing
- Stack overflow protection in recursive functions
- Dead lock prevention in threaded operations
- Race condition handling in concurrent operations

Input Validation and Security:
- All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- SQL injection prevention in database queries
- Path traversal protection in file operations
- Input size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Type checking for function parameters
- Boundary checking for array operations
- Integer overflow protection
- Floating-point precision handling
- Character encoding validation
- URL and file path validation

Web Scraping and Network Operations:
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling and session management
- Proper User-Agent and header configuration
- Response status code handling (200, 300, 400, 500 series)
- Network timeout and retry mechanisms
- Proxy support with authentication if required
- SSL/TLS certificate verification if required
- Connection cleanup after use
- Request queuing for concurrent operations

Data Processing and Storage:
- Data validation before processing
- Null value handling in all operations
- Data type conversion error handling
- Buffer overflow prevention
- File handle management and cleanup
- Database connection pooling
- Transaction management and rollback
- Duplicate data detection and handling
- Data integrity checks
- Backup and recovery procedures

Performance and Optimization:
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU bound operation optimization
- I/O operation efficiency
- Cache implementation where appropriate
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Index usage in database queries
- Algorithm complexity analysis
- Resource cleanup in error paths
- Memory fragmentation prevention

Testing and Debugging:
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for external services
- Edge case testing
- Error condition simulation
- Performance benchmarking
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Error reporting mechanism
- Test coverage measurement
- Regression testing
- Load testing for scalability

Maintenance:
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Scaling considerations
- Maintenance procedures
- Update and patch management
